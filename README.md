My name is Mohd Nawaz Hussain and I was born and bought up in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. My family is from Chittagong, Bangladesh. My preferred email address would be nawaz26893@gmail.com and my A Number is A00428036. I have experience mainly with C++ and C#. One of the topics I would like to see is how IDE's and Compilers work with the instructions given to them in more depth. My experience with Java is limited, however I am willing to learn more about it. I used C++ mainly with Unreal Engine and C# with Unity 5.


Thank you.
